# Build a 3D Drawing Web App with React & Three.js - Van Gogh's Bedroom in Arles 3D Scene

This project is a 3D drawing app built with React Three Fiber, featuring a 2D drawing canvas and an integration of Vincent van Gogh's famous painting, "Bedroom in Arles." The app allows users to draw with different brush colors and sizes while exploring a 3D representation of Van Gogh's iconic artwork.
